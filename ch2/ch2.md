# Chapter 2 - Hello Haskell
## 2.2 Interacting with Haskell code

_Prelude_ is a library of standard functions automatically loaded when opening
GHCi. To open GCHi in your Terminal (after installing _Stack_) type `stack ghci` at the
command line.

If something is _in base_ it means it is found in the Prelude.

### Working from source files

When working with Haskell code, normally a project will be comprised of _source files_, which are files denoted with the _.hs_ file extension.

[Writing a simple source file, looks like this](../blob/master/ch2/test.hs)
